# Warden Sweep

Full-repository code sweep: scan every file, verify findings with deep tracing, create draft PRs for validated issues.

**Requires**: `warden`, `gh`, `git`, `jq`, `uv`

**Important**: Run all scripts from the repository root using `${CLAUDE_SKILL_ROOT}`. Output goes to `.warden/sweeps/<run-id>/`.

## Bundled Scripts

### `scripts/scan.py`

Runs setup and scan in one call: generates run ID, creates sweep dir, checks deps, creates `warden` label, enumerates files, runs warden per file, extracts findings.

```bash
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_ROOT}/scripts/scan.py [file ...]
  --sweep-dir DIR     # Resume into existing sweep dir
```

### `scripts/index_prs.py`

Fetches open warden-labeled PRs, builds file-to-PR dedup index, caches diffs for overlapping PRs.

```bash
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_ROOT}/scripts/index_prs.py <sweep-dir>
```

### `scripts/create_issue.py`

Creates a GitHub tracking issue summarizing sweep results. Run after verification, before patching.

```bash
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_ROOT}/scripts/create_issue.py <sweep-dir>
```

### `scripts/organize.py`

Tags security findings, labels security PRs, updates finding reports with PR links, posts final results to tracking issue, generates summary report, finalizes manifest.

```bash
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_ROOT}/scripts/organize.py <sweep-dir>
```

### `scripts/extract_findings.py`

Parses warden JSONL log files and extracts normalized findings. Called automatically by `scan.py`.

```bash
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_ROOT}/scripts/extract_findings.py <log-path-or-directory> -o <output.jsonl>
```

### `scripts/generate_report.py`

Builds `summary.md` and `report.json` from sweep data. Called automatically by `organize.py`.

```bash
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_ROOT}/scripts/generate_report.py <sweep-dir>
```

### `scripts/find_reviewers.py`

Finds top 2 git contributors for a file (last 12 months).

```bash
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_ROOT}/scripts/find_reviewers.py <file-path>
```

Returns JSON: `{"reviewers": ["user1", "user2"]}`

---

## Phase 1: Scan

**Run** (1 tool call):

```bash
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_ROOT}/scripts/scan.py
```

To resume a partial scan:

```bash
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_ROOT}/scripts/scan.py --sweep-dir .warden/sweeps/<run-id>
```

Parse the JSON stdout. Save `runId` and `sweepDir` for subsequent phases.

**Report** to user:

```
## Scan Complete

Scanned **{filesScanned}** files, **{filesTimedOut}** timed out, **{filesErrored}** errors.

### Findings ({totalFindings} total)

| # | Severity | Skill | File | Title |
|---|----------|-------|------|-------|
| 1 | **HIGH** | security-review | `src/db/query.ts:42` | SQL injection in query builder |
...
```

Render every finding from the `findings` array. Bold severity for high and above.

**On failure**: If exit code 1, show the error JSON and stop. If exit code 2, show the partial results. List timed-out files separately from errored files so users know which can be retried.

---

## Phase 2: Verify

Deep-trace each finding using Task subagents to qualify or disqualify.

**For each finding in `data/all-findings.jsonl`:**

Check if `data/verify/<finding-id>.json` already exists (incrementality). If it does, skip.

Launch a Task subagent (`subagent_type: "general-purpose"`) for each finding. Process findings in parallel batches of up to 8 to improve throughput.

**Task prompt for each finding:**

```
Verify a code analysis finding. Determine if this is a TRUE issue or a FALSE POSITIVE.
Do NOT write or edit any files. Research only.

## Finding
- Title: ${TITLE}
- Severity: ${SEVERITY} | Confidence: ${CONFIDENCE}
- Skill: ${SKILL}
- Location: ${FILE_PATH}:${START_LINE}-${END_LINE}
- Description: ${DESCRIPTION}
- Verification hint: ${VERIFICATION}

## Instructions
1. Read the file at the reported location. Examine at least 50 lines of surrounding context.
2. Trace data flow to/from the flagged code using Grep/Glob.
3. Check if the issue is mitigated elsewhere (guards, validation, try/catch upstream).
4. Check if the issue is actually reachable in practice.

Return your verdict as JSON:
{
  "findingId": "${FINDING_ID}",
  "verdict": "verified" or "rejected",
  "confidence": "high" or "medium" or "low",
  "reasoning": "2-3 sentence explanation",
  "traceNotes": "What code paths you examined"
}
```

**Process results:**

Parse the JSON from the subagent response and:
- Write result to `data/verify/<finding-id>.json`
- Append to `data/verified.jsonl` or `data/rejected.jsonl`
- For verified findings, generate `findings/<finding-id>.md`:

```markdown
# ${TITLE}

**ID**: ${FINDING_ID} | **Severity**: ${SEVERITY} | **Confidence**: ${CONFIDENCE}
**Skill**: ${SKILL} | **File**: ${FILE_PATH}:${START_LINE}

## Description
${DESCRIPTION}

## Verification
**Verdict**: Verified (${VERIFICATION_CONFIDENCE})
**Reasoning**: ${REASONING}
**Code trace**: ${TRACE_NOTES}

## Suggested Fix
${FIX_DESCRIPTION}
```diff
${FIX_DIFF}
```
```

Update manifest: set `phases.verify` to `"complete"`.

**Report** to user after all verifications:

```
## Verification Complete

**{verified}** verified, **{rejected}** rejected.

### Verified Findings

| # | Severity | Confidence | File | Title | Reasoning |
|---|----------|------------|------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | **HIGH** | high | `src/db/query.ts:42` | SQL injection in query builder | User input flows directly into... |
...

### Rejected ({rejected_count})

- `{findingId}` {file}: {reasoning}
...
```

---

## Phase 3: Issue

Create a tracking issue that ties all PRs together and gives reviewers a single overview.

**Run** (1 tool call):

```bash
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_ROOT}/scripts/create_issue.py ${SWEEP_DIR}
```

Parse the JSON stdout. Save `issueUrl` and `issueNumber` for Phase 4.

**Report** to user:

```
## Tracking Issue Created

{issueUrl}
```

**On failure**: Show the error. Continue to Phase 4 (PRs can still be created without a tracking issue).

---

## Phase 4: Patch

For each verified finding, create a worktree, fix the code, and open a draft PR. Process findings **sequentially** (one at a time) since parallel subagents cross-contaminate worktrees.

**Severity triage**: Patch HIGH and above. For MEDIUM, only patch findings from bug-detection skills (e.g., `code-review`, `security-review`). Skip LOW and INFO findings.

**Step 0: Setup** (run once before the loop):

```bash
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_ROOT}/scripts/index_prs.py ${SWEEP_DIR}
```

Parse the JSON stdout. Use `fileIndex` for dedup checks.

Determine the default branch and fetch latest so worktrees branch from current upstream:

```bash
DEFAULT_BRANCH=$(gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef --jq '.defaultBranchRef.name')
git fetch origin "${DEFAULT_BRANCH}"
```

**For each finding in `data/verified.jsonl`:**

Check if finding ID already exists in `data/patches.jsonl` (incrementality). If it does, skip.

**Dedup check**: Use the file index from `index_prs.py` output to determine if an existing open PR already addresses the same issue.

1. **File match**: Look up the finding's file path in the `fileIndex`. If no PR touches that file, no conflict; proceed to Step 1.
2. **Chunk overlap**: If a PR does touch the same file, read its cached diff from `data/pr-diffs/<number>.diff` and check whether the PR's changed hunks overlap with the finding's line range (startLine-endLine). Overlapping or adjacent hunks (within ~10 lines) indicate the same code region.
3. **Same concern**: If the hunks overlap, compare the PR title and the finding title/description. Are they fixing the same kind of defect? A PR fixing an off-by-one error and a finding about a null check in the same function are different issues; both should proceed.

Skip the finding only when there is both chunk overlap AND the PR addresses the same concern. Record it in `data/patches.jsonl` with `"status": "existing"` and `"prUrl"` pointing to the matching PR, then continue to the next finding.

**Step 1: Create worktree**

```bash
BRANCH="warden-sweep/${RUN_ID}/${FINDING_ID}"
WORKTREE="${SWEEP_DIR}/worktrees/${FINDING_ID}"
git worktree add "${WORKTREE}" -b "${BRANCH}" "origin/${DEFAULT_BRANCH}"
```

Each finding branches from the repo's default branch so PRs contain only the fix commit.

**Step 2: Generate fix**

Launch a Task subagent (`subagent_type: "general-purpose"`) to apply the fix in the worktree:

````
Fix a verified code issue. You are working in a git worktree at: ${WORKTREE}

## Finding
- Title: ${TITLE}
- File: ${FILE_PATH}:${START_LINE}
- Description: ${DESCRIPTION}
- Verification: ${REASONING}
- Suggested Fix: ${FIX_DESCRIPTION}
```diff
${FIX_DIFF}
```

## Instructions

### Step 1: Understand the code
Read the file at ${WORKTREE}/${FILE_PATH}. Read at least 50 lines above and below the reported location. Trace callers and callees of the affected code using Grep/Glob to understand how it is used. Do NOT skip this step.

### Step 2: Apply a minimal fix
Apply the smallest change that addresses the finding. If the suggested diff doesn't apply cleanly, adapt it while preserving intent. Do NOT refactor surrounding code, rename variables, add comments, or make any change beyond what the finding requires.

### Step 3: Write tests
Write or update tests that verify the fix:
- Follow existing test patterns (co-located files, same framework)
- At minimum, write a test that would have caught the original bug
- Test the specific edge case, not just the happy path

Only modify the fix target and its test file.

### Step 4: Self-review
Before staging, run `git diff` in the worktree and review every changed line. Verify:
1. The change addresses the specific finding described, not something else
2. No unrelated code was modified (no drive-by cleanups, no formatting changes)
3. Trace through changed code paths: does the fix introduce any new bug, null reference, type error, or broken import?
4. Tests exercise the fix (the failure case), not just that the code runs

If ANY check fails, fix the problem before proceeding. If the suggested fix is wrong or would introduce a regression you cannot resolve, do NOT commit. Instead, skip to the output step and report why.

### Step 5: Commit
Do NOT run tests locally. CI will validate the changes.

Stage and commit with this exact message:

fix: ${TITLE}

Warden finding ${FINDING_ID}
Severity: ${SEVERITY}

Co-Authored-By: Warden <noreply@getsentry.com>

### Step 6: Output
Return ONLY valid JSON (no surrounding text). Use `"status": "applied"` if you committed a fix, or `"status": "skipped"` if you did not.

```json
{
  "status": "applied",
  "filesChanged": ["src/example.ts"],
  "testFilesChanged": ["src/example.test.ts"],
  "selfReview": "Verified the fix addresses the null check and test covers the failure case",
  "skipReason": null
}
```

When skipping:
```json
{
  "status": "skipped",
  "filesChanged": [],
  "testFilesChanged": [],
  "selfReview": null,
  "skipReason": "The suggested fix would introduce a regression in the error handling path"
}
```
````

**Step 2b: Handle skipped findings**

If the subagent returned `"status": "skipped"` (not `"applied"`), do NOT proceed to Steps 3-4. Instead:
1. Record the finding in `data/patches.jsonl` with `"status": "error"` and `"error": "Subagent skipped: ${skipReason}"`
2. Clean up the worktree
3. Continue to the next finding

**Step 3: Find reviewers**

```bash
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_ROOT}/scripts/find_reviewers.py "${FILE_PATH}"
```

**Step 4: Create draft PR**

```bash
cd "${WORKTREE}" && git push -u origin HEAD:"${BRANCH}"
```

Create the PR with a 1-2 sentence "What" summary based on the finding and fix, followed by the finding description and verification reasoning:

```bash
REVIEWERS=""
# If find_reviewers.py returned reviewers, build the flags
# e.g., REVIEWERS="--reviewer user1 --reviewer user2"

gh pr create --draft \
  --label "warden" \
  --title "fix: ${TITLE}" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
${FIX_WHAT_DESCRIPTION}

${DESCRIPTION}

${REASONING}

Automated fix for Warden finding ${FINDING_ID} (${SEVERITY}, detected by ${SKILL}).

<!-- Only include the next line if Phase 3 succeeded and ISSUE_NUMBER is available -->
Ref #${ISSUE_NUMBER}

> This PR was auto-generated by a Warden Sweep (run ${RUN_ID}).
> The finding has been validated through automated deep tracing,
> but human confirmation is requested as this is batch work.
EOF
)" ${REVIEWERS}
```

Save the PR URL.

**Step 5: Record and cleanup**

Append to `data/patches.jsonl` (use `"created"` as status for successful PRs, not the subagent's `"applied"`):
```json
{"findingId": "...", "prUrl": "https://...", "branch": "...", "reviewers": ["user1", "user2"], "filesChanged": ["..."], "status": "created|existing|error"}
```

Remove the worktree:
```bash
cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
git worktree remove "${WORKTREE}" --force
```

**Error handling**: On failure at any step, write to `data/patches.jsonl` with `"status": "error"` and `"error": "..."`, clean up the worktree, and continue to the next finding.

Update manifest: set `phases.patch` to `"complete"`.

**Report** to user after all patches:

```
## PRs Created

**{created}** created, **{skipped}** skipped (existing), **{failed}** failed.

| # | Finding | PR | Status |
|---|---------|-----|--------|
| 1 | `security-review-a1b2c3d4` SQL injection in query builder | #142 | created |
| 2 | `code-review-e5f6g7h8` Null pointer in handler | - | existing (#138) |
...
```

---

## Phase 5: Organize

**Run** (1 tool call):

```bash
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_ROOT}/scripts/organize.py ${SWEEP_DIR}
```

Parse the JSON stdout.

**Report** to user:

```
## Sweep Complete

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Files scanned | {filesScanned} |
| Findings verified | {verified} |
| PRs created | {prsCreated} |
| Security findings | {securityFindings} |

Full report: `{summaryPath}`
```

**On failure**: Show the error and note which steps completed.

---

## Resuming a Sweep

Each phase is incremental. To resume from where you left off:

1. Check `data/manifest.json` to see which phases are complete
2. For scan: pass `--sweep-dir` to `scan.py`
3. For verify: existing `data/verify/<id>.json` files are skipped
4. For issue: `create_issue.py` is idempotent (skips if `issueUrl` in manifest)
5. For patch: existing entries in `data/patches.jsonl` are skipped
6. For organize: safe to re-run (idempotent)
